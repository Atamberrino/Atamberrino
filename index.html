        <!--Write some words about yourself in the p tags-->
        <p>I am currently a senior at Virginia Tech. My major is Language and Literature, and I am on the pre-Education track in that major. I was originally in the Computer Engineering program, but I decided to change my major when I realized that I did not want to pursue a career in an engineering field. In my junior year, I decided that I wanted to become a teacher, and I also decided that I wanted to have more literature present in my life (as it had not been a major part of my life for the first few years of college). This major seemed like the best of both worlds for me.

        <h2>My project</h2>

        <p>One organization that speaks to me personally is <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/">Extra Life</a>. Extra Life is a charitable organization that utilizes gaming as a way to provide information about and raise awareness for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, as well as raise money for them through donations. I personally first heard about Extra Life through some gaming streamers on Twitch, and the concept of people playing games to promote and raise donations for the cause of children's health spoke to me. My sister, Ava, had a heart defect that was discovered at birth. She was taken to a hospital that I now know is a part of the Children's Miracle Network Hospital family, where she stayed for the first few months of her life. She is now 5 years old and living a perfectly normal life. I want to advocate for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals to allow more people to be able to live their lives to their fullest like my sister, and, being a gamer myself, Extra Life seems like a unique way to help promote this cause.
